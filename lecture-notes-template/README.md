LaTeX lecture notes template
============================

This contains a rather simple template for lecture notes and (fancy) seminar papers based on `scrartcl`. It features the color scheme of the University of Klagenfurt.

For projects using this template, ensure that `math-commands.sty`(which collects packages and commands for typesetting math) is included and the correct file path is set in the .tex file.
