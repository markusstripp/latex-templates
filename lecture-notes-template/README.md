LaTeX lecture notes template
============================

This contains a rather simple template for lecture notes and (fancy) seminar papers based on `scrartcl`. It features the color scheme of the University of Klagenfurt.

For projects using this template, ensure that the correct file path to `math-commands.sty` (which collects packages and commands for typesetting math) is included in the preamble, as it is dependent on this file.
