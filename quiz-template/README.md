Beamer quiz template
====================

This contains a rather simple template for quizzes based on the Beamer theme `aau`. The file `quiz-preamble.tex` provides a predefined command for creating quizzes that is quite self-explanatory.

For projects using this template, make sure to include the correct file path to `beamerthemeaau.sty` in the preamble of the '.tex' file. Additionally, ensure that the correct file path to `math-commands.sty` (which collects packages and commands for typesetting math) is included in `beamerthemeaau.sty`, as it is dependent on this file.
