LaTeX fancy article template
============================

This contains a rather simple template for (fancy) articles based on `scrartcl`. As signature colors, it mainly uses the color palette of Markus Tripp's homepage (`https://www.markustripp.at`), which is `#e38c95` (light coral) and `#8cc1e3` (sky blue).

For projects using this template, ensure that the correct file path to `math-commands.sty` (which collects packages and commands for typesetting math) is included in the preamble, as it is dependent on this file.
