bhxmtthesis.cls
===============

Provides the LaTeX class `bhxmtthesis`, built upon Benjamin Hackl's `bhthesis` class, available at `https://github.com/behackl/thesis-template`.

For projects using this template, ensure that the correct file path to `math-commands.sty` (which collects packages and commands for typesetting math) is included in
`bhxmtthesis.cls` as it is dependent on this file.

Note: `mtnumeric.bbx` is a custom bibliography style based on numeric provding the dashed-option.
